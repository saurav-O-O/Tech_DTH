A full-stack IoT solution that bridges physical sensor data with a modern web interface. This project utilizes an ESP8266 to capture environmental metrics and streams them instantly to a Firebase Realtime Database, which then pushes live updates to a responsive web dashboard.
🚀 Key Features

    Real-Time Data Streaming: Uses Firebase onValue listeners to update the UI instantly without page refreshes.

    Hardware Efficiency: Implements non-blocking timing logic with millis() to ensure high uptime and responsiveness.

    Automated CI/CD: Integrated GitHub Actions workflow for automatic deployment of the frontend to GitHub Pages.

    Futuristic UI: A dark-themed "Cyberpunk" dashboard featuring the Orbitron typeface and CSS glow effects.

🛠️ Tech Stack

    Hardware: ESP8266 (NodeMCU), DHT11 Temperature & Humidity Sensor.

    Backend: Firebase Realtime Database (RTDB).

    Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6 Modules).

    DevOps: GitHub Actions (YAML).

📂 Project Structure

    /ESP12E: Contains the Arduino firmware (ESP_code.ino) for data acquisition.

    /web: The frontend logic using the Firebase Web SDK.

    index.html: Main entry point with automatic dashboard redirection.

    .github/workflows: Automation script for static site hosting.

🔧 Installation & Setup
1. Hardware Configuration

    Open ESP_code.ino in the Arduino IDE.

    Install the DHT and Firebase_ESP_Client libraries.

    Enter your WiFi and Firebase credentials in the designated constants.

    Connect your DHT11 sensor to pin D4 (GPIO2).

2. Web Configuration

    Navigate to the /web/logic.js file.

    Replace the firebaseConfig object with your own Firebase Project settings.

    Push your changes to the main branch to trigger the automatic GitHub Pages deployment.

📊 Data Preview

The system currently monitors:

    Temperature (°C): Captured via DHT11 and sent as a float.

    Humidity (%): Captured via DHT11 and sent as a float.

    Heartbeat: A "Last Updated" timestamp using system millis to verify device connectivity.
